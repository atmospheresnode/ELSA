#    The following forms are mostly associated with models.  The first form, ConfirmForm, is an example 
# of a form that is not associated with any models.  The specification for the PDS4 components 
# (ex: Alias, Bundle, ...) can be found in models.py with the corresponding model object.  The comments
# for the following forms should include the input format rules.  This information may or may not need
# to be in models over forms.  I'm not too sure where we will decide to do our data checking as of yet.
# Some models listed below that have choices do include the specification as a part of data checking.
#
# TASK:  Add data checking/cleaning to fit ELSA standard.
